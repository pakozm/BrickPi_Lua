BrickPi Lua Code (bindded from BrickPi C)

In this repository is a Lua binding library of BrickPi C code. It allows
to program BrickPi using Lua programming language, and it is pretty cool.

This sofware needs Lua 5.2, which could be installed into raspbian wheezy
by executing:

- sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev
- sudo apt-get install lua5.2

Installation is done by:

- make
- make install

In Lua, the library is loaded as a package:

brickpi = require "brickpi"

The brickpi package has the following functions:

- boolean,error_message = brickpi.setup()
- 

More information on using C on the BrickPi can be found here:

BrickPi is a Raspberry Pi Board that connects LEGO MINDSTORMS
motors and sensors to the Raspberry Pi.

Examples are given under "SensorExamples" for using the different
sensors.
