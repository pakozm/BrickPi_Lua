BrickPi Lua Code (bindded from BrickPi C)

In this repository is a Lua binding library of BrickPi C code. It allows
to program BrickPi using Lua programming language, and it is pretty cool.

This sofware needs Lua 5.2, which could be installed into raspbian wheezy
by executing:

- sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev
- sudo apt-get install lua5.2

Installation is done by:

- make
- make install

In Lua, the library is loaded as a package:

brickpi = require "brickpi"

The brickpi package has the following functions:

- boolean,error_message = brickpi.setup(): initializes the BrickPi
  C environment. Returns true if everything is ok, otherwise it
  returns false and an error message string.

- brickpi.motorEnable(number, number, ...): initializes the given
  port numbers as motor ports.

- brickpi.sensorType(port_number, type_number): initializes the
  given port number as sensor of the given type.

- boolean,error_message = brickpi.setupSensors(): after motors
  and sensors initialization, this function setup the configuration.
  It returns true if everything is ok, otherwise it returns false
  and an error message string.

- brickpi.sleep(seconds): sleeps the given number of seconds. The
  number is a double, so it is possible to sleep a fraction of a
  second.

- boolean,error_message = brickpi.update(): this function updates
  the BrickPi C environment, providing motor update and sensor
  read.

- brickpi.motorSpeed(port_number, port_number, ..., speed_number):
  sets the speed of the given list of motor ports to the given speed.
  The speed is a number between [-255,255].

- speed_number = brickpi.motorSpeed(port_number): returns the speed
  set for the given motor port number.

- brickpi.motorSteering(port1, port2, steer, power): sets the speed
  of two motors (port1 and port2) depending on the steer value (in
  range [-1,1]) and in the power value (in range [-1,1]). When steer=-1
  or steer=1 the robot will spin over its center, setting the speed
  of one motor to 255*power, and the other to -255*power. When steer=0,
  speed of both motors is set to 255*power. A negative power value
  will change the direction of the movement of motors.

- brickpi.sensorValue(port_number): reads the value of the sensor
  at the given port number.

The following port and sensor numbers are available:

- brickpi.PORT_A
- brickpi.PORT_B
- brickpi.PORT_C
- brickpi.PORT_D

- brickpi.PORT_1
- brickpi.PORT_2
- brickpi.PORT_3
- brickpi.PORT_4

- brickpi.TYPE_MOTOR_PWM
- brickpi.TYPE_MOTOR_SPEED
- brickpi.TYPE_MOTOR_POSITION

- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_RAW
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_LIGHT_OFF
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_LIGHT_ON
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_TOUCH
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_ULTRASONIC_CONT
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_ULTRASONIC_SS
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_RCX_LIGHT
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_COLOR_FULL
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_COLOR_RED
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_COLOR_GREEN
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_COLOR_BLUE
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_COLOR_NONE
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_I2C
- brickpi.TYPE_SENSOR_I2C_9V

BrickPi is a Raspberry Pi Board that connects LEGO MINDSTORMS
motors and sensors to the Raspberry Pi.

Examples are given under "SensorExamples" for using the different
sensors.
